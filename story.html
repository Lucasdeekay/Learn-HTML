                        Dear Shannon,<br>
                        I'm finally settled in at the Lancaster School of Design. I think I am going to like it
                        here. Not only is the college rated in the top ten, but the area is beautiful, and the Amish 
                        I've seen are unbelievable! I haven't met any of them up close and personal, but from what 
                        I've seen, the women are simple, dark-colored dresses, with little white hats on their heads. 
                        The men wear cotton shirts, dark pants with suspenders, and either a straw or black felt hat 
                        with a wide brim. They drive box-shaped, closed-in buggies pulled by a horse.

                        Tomorrow, I'm goin to the farmers' market. I hear it's a great place to get good buys on 
                        handmade Amish quilts. I may even be able to acquire some helpful decorating ideas there.
                    </p>

                        I hope you're doing well and enjoying your new job. I'm looking forward to seeing you at Christmas 
                        and hearing about those preschoolers you teach.
